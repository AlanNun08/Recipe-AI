new ideas for starbucks recipes section
to share recipes, there should be 2 sections
1 sections will take care of the top 5 reciepes of the week and users can add those recipes to their own recipe history
    the top 5 recipes will only stay there for a week before they are update
2nd section will take care of people voting on the recipes they think should be on the top 5 sections and the ones with the most votes gets 
    added to the section when it times to update, this will be 24 hrs before the top 5 gets updated
there will need to be 2 sections in the database
1st will have the recipes that everyone will be able to see
2nd will have the recipes that are shared by people so they get people from recipe history of an own user and it will be moved to a section 
    where everyone will be able to see
